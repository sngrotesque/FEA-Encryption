This repository is [an independent version of the WMKC library FEA encryption algorithm](https://github.com/sngrotesque/WMKC) and does not rely on the [WMKC](https://github.com/sngrotesque/WMKC) library.

This encryption algorithm is a symmetric encryption algorithm with a block size of 128 bits and uses a 256 bit key for encryption and decryption.

There are currently four encryption methods available: ECB, CBC, CTR, and CFB.

> As an encryption algorithm, the avalanche effect is necessary. You (the user) can freely test the security of this algorithm. If it is not secure, please contact me.
